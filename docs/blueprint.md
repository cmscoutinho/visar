# **App Name**: Empathy Vision

## Core Features:

- Glaucoma Simulation: Simulate vision with glaucoma using dynamic masks controlled by cursor movement, applying peripheral vision loss in real-time to displayed content.
- Macular Degeneration Simulation: Model macular degeneration by dynamically blurring the central field of vision, adjustable based on user input to represent varying severity levels.
- Cataracts Simulation: Apply a blurring effect that mimics cataracts, with adjustable intensity to simulate different stages of the condition. 
- Eye-Tracking Integration: Incorporate WebGazer.js for optional eye-tracking, enhancing the realism of visual impairment simulations by synchronizing mask movements with the user's gaze (consent required).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blues (#283593) to evoke a sense of seriousness and empathy.
- Secondary color: Soft grays (#E0E0E0) to provide a neutral backdrop.
- Accent: Teal (#009688) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Clear and highly legible fonts for accessibility.
